# CURA Healthcare Page
In this repository you can find the automation project I did for [CURA Healthcare Service](https://katalon-demo-cura.herokuapp.com/profile.php#login) page, as part of the Smart Talent technical test. 

The solution is made in Java, and integrates different tools such as Selenium, JUnit and Maven, using the Page Objet Model design pattern.

In order to run the project you must make sure you have the following tools installed:
- *Java JDK 11.0.17* 
- *Apache Maven 3.9.0*

You must also include the following dependencies in your POM file:
- *selenium-api 4.8.1*
- *selenium-support 4.8.3*
- *junit 4.13.2*
- *selenium-firefox-driver 4.8.3*

**Note:** All dependencies can be found in [Maven repository](https://mvnrepository.com/)
